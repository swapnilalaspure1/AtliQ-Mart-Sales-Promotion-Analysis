🚀 Excited to share my recent project on AtliQ Market Data Analysis! 📊

I've just wrapped up an exhilarating project where I delved into the depths of AtliQ Market Data to extract actionable insights and drive informed decisions. Here's a sneak peek into what I accomplished:

✂️ Data Cleaning and Transformation: Leveraging Power Query, I meticulously cleaned and transformed the raw data, splitting columns, changing data types, and renaming columns to ensure accuracy and clarity in analysis.

🔄 Custom Column Functions: Utilizing custom column functions, I derived new columns tailored to specific transformation requirements, enabling deeper analysis and uncovering hidden patterns within the data.

📈 Measures and Visualization: Through Power BI, I crafted dynamic measures and visually engaging dashboards, allowing stakeholders to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue, Inventory Turnover Ratio (IUS), and more with ease.

🔍 Interactive Reporting: With slicers, filters, and navigation buttons, I made the report highly interactive, empowering users to explore data from different perspectives and extract actionable insights on the fly.

This project not only honed my skills in data analysis and visualization but also showcased my ability to translate complex data into actionable insights that drive business growth.
